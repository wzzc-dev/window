# Architecture Risks

This document tracks macOS architecture risks that should remain explicit during
future parity work.

Window module paths in this document, such as `macos/window.mbt`, are relative
to `modules/window`.

## Native Lifecycle And Callback Bridge

Risk: `macos/native_appkit.m` owns AppKit object lifetimes and calls back into
MoonBit. Incorrect ownership around `NSEvent`, `NSDraggingInfo`, delegates, or
views can cause invalid memory access that is hard to reproduce.

Current control:

- `scripts/check_ffi_surface.sh` prevents accidental FFI surface growth and
  payload-wrapper regressions.
- Native lifecycle responsibilities are split by ownership boundary:
  `native_appkit_callbacks.m` owns global MoonBit callback registration and
  trampoline invocation; `native_appkit_observers.m` owns notification/run-loop
  observer lifetimes; `native_appkit_window.m` owns `NSView`/`NSWindowDelegate`
  lifetimes and short-lived `NSEvent`/`NSDraggingInfo` handoff.
- Drag-and-drop callbacks snapshot `NSDraggingInfo` inside ObjC and pass only
  physical position plus UTF-8 path payloads to MoonBit.
- Global `sendEvent:` device-event interception snapshots `NSEvent` inside ObjC
  and passes only device-event kind, button, and motion delta to MoonBit.
- View-level mouse, scroll, gesture, key, modifier, and IME forwarding paths
  snapshot `NSEvent` inside ObjC and pass primitive/c-string payloads to
  MoonBit. IME key-down forwarding uses MoonBit pending key snapshot state
  instead of replaying an AppKit event handle.
- Native input callback payload normalization is isolated in
  `macos/native_input_payload.mbt`, keeping raw callback arguments, modifier
  text normalization, text-input callback payloads, pending-key snapshots, and
  event translation behind one MoonBit seam.
- Window close begins with an explicit native closing marker. The marker
  removes content-view frame observers, clears the content-view raw id, blocks
  normal delegate/drag event emission, and lets the delegate emit `Destroyed`
  at most once before clearing its raw id.
- `MBWWindowBox` is the single owner for the retained `NSWindow`, content view,
  and delegate graph after creation; local `alloc` ownership is released after
  property transfer, and box teardown releases its strong properties.
- MoonBit now stores owned macOS windows as the opaque `NativeWindow` external
  object, not as an owned `UInt64`. `mbw_create_window` returns an external
  object whose finalizer destroys the `MBWWindowBox`; `Window::drop` explicitly
  calls the same native destroy path for prompt teardown. If the finalizer runs
  off the AppKit main thread, teardown is transferred back to the main thread.
  Public generic window/display handle getters return structured
  `Milky2018/windowing` handles whose provider objects keep the originating
  window or event loop reachable.
- Native callback trampolines retain MoonBit closures for the duration of each
  invocation, so callback-driven teardown or observer removal cannot release a
  closure while it is still being invoked.
- The synchronous main-thread bridge borrows both FFI callback parameters and
  pins the closure only around the MoonBit trampoline invocation. This avoids
  both transferring an unconsumed owned reference and retaining the closure
  beyond `dispatch_sync_f`.
- Native notification/run-loop observer creation consumes owned MoonBit
  closures on every failure path. Notification observers also retain themselves
  during callback dispatch so callback-driven observer removal cannot deallocate
  the observer before the Objective-C method returns.
- MoonBit stores notification and run-loop observers as opaque external objects
  with native finalizers. Explicit `EventLoop::drop` removal clears the native
  owner pointer first, so a later finalizer is idempotent instead of double
  releasing the observer or transferred closure.
- Copied `CGDisplayModeRef` values are represented as `NativeDisplayMode`
  external objects. Temporary video-mode enumeration still releases promptly,
  and the external finalizer covers fullscreen saved-mode state if explicit
  restore cleanup is skipped.
- Copied CoreFoundation objects that cross into MoonBit, such as
  `CGDisplayCreateUUIDFromDisplayID` results, are represented as private
  external objects. MoonBit can borrow the raw handle for CoreGraphics queries
  but never owns the `CFTypeRef` as a plain integer.
- Custom `NSCursor` values created from RGBA data are retained by a
  backend-agnostic `CustomCursorHandle` external object stored inside
  `core.CustomCursor`. `CustomCursor::into_raw()` remains a borrowed AppKit
  pointer projection used only at the platform edge.
- AppKit-backed external-object finalizers now share the same thread contract:
  prompt explicit cleanup clears the external wrapper immediately, and any
  AppKit/RunLoop teardown reached from a GC finalizer is transferred back to
  the main thread before releasing native objects or unregistering observers.
- Default-menu and unified-titlebar construction no longer carry owned
  `NSMenu`/`NSMenuItem`/`NSToolbar` objects as plain `UInt64`. Short-lived +1
  Objective-C objects are wrapped in a private `NativeObjcObject` external
  object; selector calls receive borrowed raw handles, and explicit
  release/finalizer cleanup is idempotent.
- GitHub issue #5 remains open until the reporter confirms the latest release
  no longer reproduces the callback lifetime failure.

Required direction:

- Keep ownership fixes in the bridge layer, not in MoonBit-side defensive
  workarounds.
- Prefer narrowing FFI entry points and centralizing callback payload ownership
  before adding more native callbacks.
- Do not move callback registry, AppKit observer ownership, and window delegate
  ownership back into the same native source file.

## AppState Runtime Reentrancy

Risk: `AppStateRuntime` is a singleton-style runtime that coordinates event
queueing, active loop state, callbacks, and exit semantics. Reentrant AppKit
callbacks can violate assumptions if queue transitions are not explicit.

Current control:

- macOS, core, and dpi tests execute through `moon test --release` in
  `scripts/check_ci.sh`.
- Event-loop construction and every run entry point check the process main
  thread before initializing or running `NSApplication`, observers, or run-loop
  state. The cross-platform `with_any_thread` preference cannot bypass this
  AppKit requirement. `scripts/check_event_loop_thread_boundary.sh` keeps all
  three run entry points behind the shared runtime guard.
- Public `Window` methods that touch AppKit or mutable window state keep their
  implementation and synchronous main-thread dispatch in one definition at the
  relevant domain implementation site. `dispatch_sync_f` transfers the complete
  operation when called from a worker thread, preserving ordering across compound
  fullscreen, cursor, and IME operations.
- `scripts/check_window_thread_boundary.sh` rejects one-to-one `_on_main`
  mirrors and checks every thread-bound public `Window` method block for exactly
  one synchronous dispatch, in addition to verifying the native dispatch policy.
- Deferred callback queue mutation is isolated in
  `macos/app_state_deferred_queue.mbt`; AppState dispatch code uses the queue
  seam instead of directly pushing, searching, or removing deferred callbacks.
- Event-loop run-state and handler-state mutation is isolated in
  `macos/app_state_run_state.mbt`; AppState dispatch code no longer directly
  mutates running, launched, stop, exit, will-terminate, or dispatch-handler
  fields.
- White-box AppState/View tests use local fixture helpers for runtime reset,
  dispatch callback setup, deferred queue inspection, and window identity
  fixtures; direct `app_state_runtime.val` access is confined to those helpers.
- Deferred callback draining re-checks that a registered dispatch handler still
  exists before each queue pop, so a callback that clears the handler cannot
  cause the next deferred event to be removed and dropped.

Required direction:

- Treat new event-loop behavior as state-machine work and add white-box tests
  for queue ordering, exit, and callback reentrancy.
- Keep worker-thread `Window` support aligned with winit: dispatch complete
  operations synchronously rather than exposing AppKit calls to caller threads.
- Avoid spreading AppState mutation across unrelated window methods.

## Framework-Linked Native Test Execution

Risk: default debug `moon test` can still fail AppKit-linked native tests through
the MoonBit native runner because that path can use `tcc -run`, which fails on
macOS framework arguments.

Current control:

- `scripts/check_ci.sh` uses `moon test --release`, which executes the
  framework-linked macOS tests reliably on the local target.
- `docs/testing.md` documents the debug-runner limitation and the expected
  validation command.

Required direction:

- Keep release-mode executable tests as the local gate until debug native test
  execution handles AppKit framework arguments consistently.

## Opaque Native Handles

Risk: AppKit handles still cross the final MoonBit/native FFI edge as integers.
Leaking those integers into generic APIs would erase backend identity and make
ownership and lifetime contracts ambiguous.

Current control:

- The repository is a two-module workspace. `modules/windowing` contains
  `Milky2018/windowing`, which defines backend-neutral
  `RawWindowHandle`/`RawDisplayHandle` variants and provider traits without
  depending on the `wzzc-dev/window` compatibility module in `modules/window`.
- `WindowHandle` and `DisplayHandle` keep a provider trait object, so the
  originating window/event-loop owner remains reachable while a handle exists.
- The public AppKit window handle is `RawWindowHandle::AppKit` containing an
  `AppKitWindowHandle`; the `NSView*` integer is exposed only after an explicit
  platform match. A handle obtained before `Window::drop()` subsequently
  returns `HandleError::Unavailable` rather than a cached dangling pointer.
- `Window::content_view_handle()` remains a documented platform-specific escape
  hatch. `monitor_ns_screen` instead resolves on the AppKit main thread and
  creates its external-object owner before returning across FFI. MoonBit
  receives that owner directly inside a retained `NSScreenHandle` snapshot;
  its raw pointer projection is valid only while that handle remains alive.
- Internal high-traffic registered AppKit window lookup has a
  `BorrowedObjcHandle` adapter at the cursor hittest seam. Owned native
  resources still use external objects with finalizers instead of plain
  `UInt64`.

Required direction:

- Keep raw handle APIs narrow and document whether a handle is borrowed,
  retained, stable, or only valid during a callback.
- Keep `windowing` independent of concrete window and renderer modules.
- Renderer modules should consume `HasWindowHandle`/`HasDisplayHandle` instead
  of depending on `macos.Window` or accepting an untyped integer.
- Treat `NSScreenHandle` as a display-configuration snapshot and resolve a new
  handle after monitor reconfiguration rather than caching its raw pointer.
- Do not represent owned native resources as plain `UInt64`; use external
  objects with finalizers and expose borrowed raw pointers only at the API edge.
- Do not expose internal selectors such as `rawId` as renderer integration API.

## Backend File Size And Responsibility Split

Risk: window behavior can regress into one coordination file that mixes raw
AppKit dispatch, creation policy, fullscreen transitions, and public methods.

Current control:

- Behavior-sensitive parity fixes are tracked in `docs/macos-issue-tracker.md`.
- Per-window platform state lives in focused state modules:
  `macos/window_platform_state.mbt` for IME/cursor/first-mouse state and
  `macos/window_fullscreen_state.mbt` for fullscreen transition and maximized
  standard frame state.
- Native window request error conversion lives in
  `macos/window_request_error.mbt`; cursor hittest, cursor position, cursor
  grab, drag, and drag-resize paths share the same status/result conversion
  policy.
- Cursor construction, selector fallback, system-resource loading, and retained
  cursor caching live in `macos/cursor.mbt`; the window delegate only applies
  the resolved AppKit cursor to a window.
- Fullscreen transition and queued target state are stored together per window
  in `macos/window_fullscreen_state.mbt`, matching the upstream delegate state
  model instead of leaking delayed requests into global application state.
- Drag-and-drop native payload conversion lives as a pure function in
  `macos/event.mbt`; callback sites only enqueue the resulting window event.
- Raw window selector and Objective-C ABI composition lives in the internal
  `macos/window_appkit.mbt` adapter.
- Initial attribute, size, monitor, and positioning policy lives in
  `macos/window_creation.mbt`.
- Borderless, simple, and exclusive fullscreen behavior lives in
  `macos/window_fullscreen.mbt`; transition storage remains in the focused
  `macos/window_fullscreen_state.mbt` module.
- `scripts/check_window_thread_boundary.sh` rejects raw Objective-C calls in
  high-level window modules, native adapter leakage, public adapter methods,
  `_on_main` mirrors, and missing responsibility seams.

Required direction:

- Keep the current dependency direction: FFI primitives feed the internal
  AppKit adapter, which feeds creation/fullscreen/window behavior.
- Split further only when a behavior change or test identifies another coherent
  seam. Do not reintroduce one-to-one forwarding facades or line-count-driven
  file churn.
